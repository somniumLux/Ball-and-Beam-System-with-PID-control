# Ball_and_Beam_System_with_PID_control

BALL AND BEAM SYSTEM PROJECT WITH PID CONTROL OF BALL'S POSITION

This is a little Arduino project I created for my bachealor thesis as an electrical engineering student.

The Arduino code is used to control position of a ping pong ball on a beam, tilting the beam with a servo motor precisly
in order to set the ball back in middle position of the beam if it gets moved. An ultrasonic sensor is used to monitor
position of the ball and Arduino Uno board was used.

The project includes basics of Automation Control theory, no mathematical model was created so the PID parameters were
set experimentaly. Also, simple MatLab code is incldued in the project which was used to graph ball position over time.
